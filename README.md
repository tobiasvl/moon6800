moon6800
========

A Motorola M6800 emulator core written in Lua.

Requirements
------------

Either the `bit32` or [BitOp](http://bitop.luajit.org) module for bitwise operators.

Usage
-----

This emulator core is modular, like the early microcomputers. It should be able to emulate most M6800-based computers, but you need to "wire it up" yourself, just like the old days.

See the following projects for examples on how to use it in your own programs:

* [DRÃ–M](https://github.com/tobiasvl/drom) (DREAM 6800 emulator)
